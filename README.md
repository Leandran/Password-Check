# A program to check if the password is strong enough to use.


# The password Strength is determined by: 
○ The length of the password (at least 6 characters) (haveLength) 
○ Needs to contain uppercase letters (upCase) 
○ Needs to contain lowercase letters (lowCase) 
○ Needs to contain numbers (haveNum) 
 
#Conditions to be met:

● Declare Boolean variables for each one of these characteristics.  
● You will find the name of the variable next to the condition above. They                            
  must all be initialised as false.  
● Then ask the user a series of yes or no questions for each variable, and                              
  change the Boolean variable to True based on their answer. 
● Once 3 of the characteristics are met (3 of the variables == True) then display                              
  a message saying this is a suitable password.
